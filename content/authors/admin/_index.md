I am currently a Research Assistant at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou), focusing on 3D anomaly detection using CLIP and few-shot learning approaches. Previously, I worked as an Assistant Engineer at Shenzhen Junming AI Technology, where I contributed to vision systems for intelligent oil palm fruit harvesting robots.

I earned a Bachelor's degree with first-class honors from Hong Kong Baptist University, where I graduated in the top 10% of my class with a GPA of 3.69/4.0. My expertise spans Python (PyTorch, TensorFlow), Java, and C++, with significant experience in deep learning applications and computer vision.

My research interests include improving neural network robustness against adversarial attacks and developing efficient methods for anomaly detection in 3D point clouds. My most recent project involves leveraging CLIP's vision-text representation space for few-shot 3D industrial anomaly detection.
