I earned a Bachelor's degree with first-class honor from the Computer Science Department within the Faculty of Science at Hong Kong Baptist University. Throughout my academic journey, I have focused extensively on advancements in deep learning and their practical applications. My expertise lies in Python and Java programming, and I have gained hands-on experience with deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow. 
During my Final Year Project, I conducted research on enhancing the robustness of neural networks. I developed a novel framework that combines transfer learning with optimization-based pruning techniques. This project provided valuable insights into the trade-offs between accuracy and robustness in neural networks. It reflects my keen interest  my dedication to research.
